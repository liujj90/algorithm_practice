# Counting SCC with Kosaraju's Algorithm

Here is my implementation of counting strongly connected components in a directed graph, an assignment from Stanford's coursera-algorithm course. 

Some implementation notes: python is quite picky with the recursion depth, and the only way to work is to manually set a higher recursion depth and stack size within the script.

The current settins worked on my ubuntu (16.04 LTS) virtual box.
