This is where I drop my practice scripts with algorithms as they come by. They can be from courses, or just general interests in the web

### Percolation
Based of the Princeton's highly rated algorithms courseara, this implementation in python uses the weighted quick union find algorithm to solve a percolation problem. Basically, by randomly making a cell in an nxn grid vacant, calculate the probability of it reaching percolation (ie. is the path betweem top and bottom open?).
